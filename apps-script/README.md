# Apps Script

This directory contains the script that populates the "Repos" tab on the [dependencies spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/137KZhjctJ8qTKYPnq2QNVkyoIC6ok7KA2G1vErNC6Oo/edit#gid=1160366178). Whenever the script is updated, it needs to be manually copied to the spreadsheet's "Apps Script" extension.

## How to make changes

After getting your changes approved and merged, you need to follow these steps:

- Go to the spreadsheet
- Click Extensions -> Apps Script
- Paste the new code in and save
- Press "Update Data" in the spreadsheet to run the script (you will be asked for permission when doing this for the first time)
